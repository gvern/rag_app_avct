# Advanced ChatBot Application
-----------------------------------------


## Setup

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Setup a virtual environment/pyenv/pipenv with python==3.10.12
    3. Package install :

        ```bash
        cd pkg
        pip install -e .
        ```
    
    'pip install -e' will install the package in editable mode, so you can modify the code and test it without reinstalling the package (symlink to the source code)
 
    4. Very important:

        copy .env. to .env.local and edit DATA_PATH and OPENAI_API_KEY, once you receive it.
    





## Rag Service

A Singleton instance of `RagService` provides the following methods:

```python
from advanced_chatbot.services.rag_service import RagService
doc_path = "~/home/me/ai_chat/pkg/advanced_chatbot/data/livre_ux_digital_design_lab_1.pdf"

# 1. Loading the document (Indexing/Ingestion)
index_id, _ = RagService.create_vector_store_index(doc_path)
#The index id is a six character randomly generated string, which serves as identifier of an indexed document.



# 2. Querying the document
query = "What is the role of a UX designer?"
output, sources = RagService.query(query, [], [index_id])

# 3. Displaying the output
for x in output:
    print(x)

# 4. Displaying the sources
for x in sources:
    print(x.get_text())

# 5. Get the language (fr, en of an index)
lang = RagService.detect_document_language(index_id)
```

## MOCK LLM and EMBEDDING

During development stage and until you get the OpenAI key, 
you will can  MockLLM and MockEmbedding.
- MockLLM which typically returns the same question as the answer.
- MOckEmbedding returns an random embedding with a dimensoin of 1536

To enable mock models, in config.py

```python [config.py]
USE_MOCK_MODELS = True
```


## Test DATA.
The code comes with five documents in the pkg/advacned_chatbot_data folder.
You can use them those document during the development stage.

## Caution
You should not **commit** any additional data (pdf, etc) in this repository.
